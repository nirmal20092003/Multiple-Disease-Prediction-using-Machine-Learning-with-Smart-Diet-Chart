## 🧠 Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning with Smart Diet Chart

*Smart Health Analysis Website System* is an AI-powered health prediction platform designed to improve healthcare accessibility and assist in early disease detection. This web-based application uses *machine learning models built with Python* to predict multiple diseases based on user-input health parameters and also suggests a *smart diet chart* tailored to the prediction.

### 🔍 Key Features:

* 🧬 *Multi-Disease Prediction*: Predicts conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and more using trained ML models.
* 🍽 *Smart Diet Chart*: Generates personalized diet recommendations based on predicted disease and user inputs.
* ⚙ *ML-Driven Backend: Developed using **Flask*, integrating multiple machine learning models for accurate analysis.
* 💻 *Interactive Frontend: Built with **HTML, **CSS, and **JavaScript* for an intuitive user experience.
* 📊 *User-Friendly Interface*: Clean and responsive design ensuring smooth navigation and accessibility.

### 🎯 Objectives:

* Utilize AI and ML to assist in *early disease detection*.
* Offer *health and dietary suggestions* based on prediction results.
* Improve healthcare *awareness and decision-making* through data-driven insights.

### 🛠 Tech Stack:

* *Frontend*: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* *Backend*: Python, Flask
* *ML Libraries*: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
* *Deployment*: (Optional - add if using Heroku, Render, etc.)

### 🚀 How It Works:

1. User enters health parameters into a simple form.
